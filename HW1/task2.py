"""Read but DON'T TOUCH the Quote - go to Question 2 below"""

Quote = "A few people laughed; a few people cried. Most people were silent. " \
       "I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita; " \
       "Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty, " \
       "and to impress him, takes on his multiarmed form and says, " \
       "â€˜Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.â€™ " \
       "I suppose we all thought that, one way or another."



"""
Question 2
Use string handling functions (see textbook p.5) to determine the following
a)
the number of times the number of characters in the quote fit in to 23.
"""
def numTimesQuoteIn23() -> int:
    #write your code here and return the variable which stores the answer to question 2.a
    return 0# you are expected to replace this 0 return value.

"""
b)
the two numbers representing the start and the end indices of the substring "Now I am become Death, 
the destroyer of worlds" (excluding the quote marks) - to help you check your answer you might choose to
use those numbers to see if you can extract the substring from the quote. This can be done using Python 
syntax: Quote[0:10] would, for instance, return the string: "A few peop" - use the test space below to 
try this out.
"""
def startAndEndIndicesOfSubString() -> tuple[int, int]:
    # write your code here
    return 0, 0 #return the variables storing the int at the start of the quote first
